# Game Of Life - (John Conway) remake on ASIC
## How it works
ill explain this later,

## How to test

Once the ASIC is powered it should automatically turn on and generate cellular autamota in patterns through Game of Lifes rules. by inputting a high signal to port 0 it stops the simulation where it was, and inputting a high signal to port 1 it will randomize the game.

## External hardware

a  [Tiny Tapeout VGA Pmod](https://store.tinytapeout.com/products/TinyVGA-Pmod-p678647356). and possibly buttons or switches im unsure for port 0 and 1
