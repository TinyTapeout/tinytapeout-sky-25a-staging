# Tiny Tapeout project information
project:
  title:        "Sorta 4-Bit ALU"      # Project title
  author:       "Aria Mitra"      # Your name
  discord:      ""      # Your discord username, for communication and automatically assigning you a Tapeout role (optional)
  description:  "This is a kind of ALU that can do 4 bit addition, subtraction, multiplication, and bitwise operators like AND, OR, and XOR."      # One line description of what your project does
  language:     "Verilog" # other examples include SystemVerilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  clock_hz:     0       # Clock frequency in Hz (or 0 if not applicable)

  # How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "1x1"          # Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 3x2, 4x2, 6x2 or 8x2

  # Your top module name must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username:
  top_module:  "tt_um_sortaALUAriaMitra"

  # List your project's source files here.
  # Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately, one per line.
  # Don't forget to also update `PROJECT_SOURCES` in test/Makefile.

# The pinout of your project. Leave unused pins blank. DO NOT delete or add any pins.
# This section is for the datasheet/website. Use descriptive names (e.g., RX, TX, MOSI, SCL, SEG_A, etc.).
