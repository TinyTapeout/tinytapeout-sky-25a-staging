## How it works

This project implements a single ended OTA (Operational Transconductance Amplifier) using a folded cascode architecture

## How to test

To test the OTA, connect a differential input signal to the INp and INm analog pins (ua[2] and ua[1] respectively). Connect VDD to 1.8V and VSS to ground. Observe the differential output voltage at the OUT pin (ua[0]) using an oscilloscope or measurement instrument.
