## How it works

This is a simulation of a simple pedestrian traffic light controller. It toggles between green and red lights every free seconds with a countdown.

## How to test

The best way to test this project is to simply observe the output pins. After the countdown resets, we will see the uo[0] and uo[1] swap values.

## External hardware

No external hardware was explicitly used, but connected LEDs would be a fun way to visualize the change in light values/states.
