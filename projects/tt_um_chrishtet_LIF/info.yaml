  author:       "Chris Htet"      # Your name
  discord:      "ChrisHtet"      # Your discord username, for communication and automatically assigning you a Tapeout role (optional)
  description:  "Fixed-point accumulator with leak and a comparator to fire a spike when voltage is greater than threshold"      # One line description of what your project does
  language:     "Verilog" # other examples include SystemVerilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  clock_hz:     50000000       # Clock frequency in Hz (or 0 if not applicable)

  # How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "1x1"          # Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 3x2, 4x2, 6x2 or 8x2

  # Your top module name must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username:
  top_module:  "tt_um_chrishtet_LIF"
