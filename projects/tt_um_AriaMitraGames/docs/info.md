## How it works

This is basically a chip where people can either play tic tac toe or rock paper scissors. Tic tac toe is a two person game and rock paper scissors is where one person plays against the machine. This works by using a 3-bit LFSR. The results of the game are outputted (please look at the pinout for more understanding of specifics).

## How to test

Connect things. To play the game, put in your moves/choices as inputs and figure out the ouputs.

## External hardware

It can be connected to a LED display for ease of use.
